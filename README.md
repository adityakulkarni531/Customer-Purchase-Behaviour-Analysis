# Customer-Purchase-Behaviour-Analysis


## Project Title: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

##Description:
In this project, I analyzed a sales dataset to generate various analytics and insights into customers' past purchase behavior. The project involved multiple stages, from basic data importation to advanced SQL querying and data visualization.

##Key tasks and skills demonstrated in this project include:

Data Importation:
Imported sales data into the SQL Server Database for analysis.

Data Analysis with SQL:
Aggregate Functions: Utilized SQL aggregate functions to calculate metrics such as total sales revenue, average purchase value, and customer purchase frequency.
Window Functions: Applied SQL window functions to perform running totals, moving averages, and other complex calculations over a specified dataset window.
Sub Queries: Implemented sub-queries to filter and organize data for detailed insights.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used CTEs for simplifying complex queries and improving readability.
SQL XML Path Function: Leveraged the SQL XML Path function to concatenate and format data.

Customer Segmentation:
Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

Data Visualization with Tableau:
Created interactive dashboards and visualizations in Tableau to present insights from the sales data effectively.
Visualized key performance indicators and customer segments to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
